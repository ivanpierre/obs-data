# Morph

Morph is a tool for managing existing NixOS hosts - basically a fancy wrapper around `nix-build`, `nix copy`, `nix-env`, `/nix/store/.../bin/switch-to-configuration`, `scp` and more. Morph supports updating multiple hosts in a row, and with support for health checks makes it fairly safe to do so.
