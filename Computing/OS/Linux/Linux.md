## [Major Distros](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major)
The bewildering choice and the ever increasing number of Linux distributions can be confusing for those who are new to Linux. This is why this page was created. It lists 10 Linux distributions (plus an honourable mention of [FreeBSD](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#freebsd), by far the most popular of all of the BSDs), which are generally considered as most widely-used (directly or indirectly) by Linux users around the world. There are no figures to back it up and there are many other distributions that might suit your particular purpose better, but as a general rule, all of these are popular and have very active forums or mailing lists where you can ask questions if you get stuck.  
  
[Ubuntu](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#ubuntu), [Linux Mint](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#mint), and [MX Linux](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#mx) are considered the easiest for new users who want to get productive in Linux as soon as possible without having to master all its complexities. On the other end of the spectrum, [Arch Linux](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#arch), [Gentoo](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#gentoo), and [Slackware Linux](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#slackware) are more advanced distributions that require plenty of learning before they can be used effectively. [openSUSE](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#opensuse), [Fedora](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#fedora), [Debian GNU/Linux](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major#debian) can be classified as good "middle-road" distributions which are often used as the basis for other distributions.

## [Distros by popularity](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity)
The DistroWatch Page Hit Ranking statistics have attracted plenty of attention and feedback over the years. Originally, each distribution-specific page was pure HTML with a third-party counter at the bottom to monitor interest of visitors. In May 2004 the site switched from publicly viewable third-party counters to internal counters. This was prompted by a continuous abuse of the counters by a handful of undisciplined individuals who had confused DistroWatch with a poll station. The counters are no longer displayed on the individual distributions pages, but all visits are logged. Only **one hit per IP address per day** is counted.  
  
The DistroWatch Page Hit Ranking statistics are a light-hearted way of measuring the popularity of Linux distributions and other free operating systems among the visitors of this website. They correlate neither to usage nor to quality and should not be used to measure the market share of distributions. They simply show the number of times a distribution page on DistroWatch.com was accessed each day, nothing more.  
  
The tables below display the average number of page hits for each distribution over a given period of time. To see information on page hit trends over a set period of time, please see our [Page Hit Ranking Trends](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=trending) page. To see how our readers rank distributions based on visitor-submitted ratings, please see our [Ranking](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=ranking) page.  
  
The figures in the third column of each table represent the **average number of hits per day (HPD)** for the specified period. The tables are updated daily at around 30 minutes past midnight GMT.
