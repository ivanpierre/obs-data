# infrastructure as code

**Infrastructure as code** (**IaC**) is the process of managing and provisioning computer [data centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center "Data center") through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code#cite_note-AWS_in_Action,_IaC-1) The [IT infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_infrastructure "IT infrastructure") managed by this process comprises both physical equipment, such as [bare-metal servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-metal_server "Bare-metal server"), as well as [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine "Virtual machine"), and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_Control_System "Version Control System"). It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming "Declarative programming") approaches.
