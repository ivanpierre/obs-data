# Cloud Native Computing Foundation

[[Cloud Native]] Computing Foundation (CNCF) serves as the vendor-neutral home for many of the fastest-growing open source projects, including [[Kubernetes]], [[Prometheus]], and [[Envoy]].

The [[Cloud Native]] Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosts critical components of the global technology infrastructure. CNCF brings together the world’s top developers, end users, and vendors and runs the largest open source developer conferences. CNCF is part of the nonprofit Linux Foundation.

## Foundation

The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF) is one of the projects hosted by [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). CNCF aims to accelerate the adoption of containers, [[Microservices]], and [[Cloud Native]] applications.

CNCF hosts a multitude of projects, with more to be added in the future. CNCF provides resources to each of the projects, but, at the same time, each project continues to operate independently under its pre-existing governance structure and with its existing maintainers. Projects within CNCF are categorized based on achieved status: Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated. At the time of this writing, a dozen projects had reached Graduated status with many more Incubating and in the Sandbox.

Graduated projects:

-   [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for [[Container Orchestration]]
-   [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for monitoring
-   [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) for service mesh
-   [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) for service discovery
-   [containerd](http://containerd.io/) for [[Containers]] runtime
-   [Fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org/) for logging
-   [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) for registry
-   [Helm](https://www.helm.sh/) for package management
-   [Vitess](http://vitess.io/) for [[Cloud Native]] storage
-   [Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger) for distributed tracing
-   [TUF](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification) for software updates
-   [TiKV](https://tikv.org/) for key/value store

Incubating projects:

-   [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/) for [[Containers]] runtime
-   [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) for service mesh
-   [Contour](https://projectcontour.io/) for ingress
-   [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io) for key/value store
-   [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) for remote procedure call (RPC)
-   [CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) for networking API
-   [Rook](https://github.com/rook/rook) for [[Cloud Native]] storage
-   [Notary](https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary) for security
-   [NATS](https://nats.io/) for messaging
-   [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/) for distributed tracing
-   [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) for policy
-   And many [more](https://www.cncf.io/projects/).

There are many projects in the CNCF [Sandbox](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/) geared towards metrics, monitoring, identity, scripting, serverless, nodeless, edge, expecting to achieve Incubating and possibly Graduated status. While many active projects are preparing for takeoff, others are being [archived](https://www.cncf.io/archived-projects/) once they become less active. The first archived project is the [rkt](https://github.com/rkt/rkt) [[Containers]] runtime. 

The projects under CNCF cover the entire lifecycle of a [[Cloud Native]] application, from its execution using [[Containers]] runtimes, to its monitoring and logging. This is very important to meet the goals of CNCF.

## CNCF and Kubernetes

For [[Kubernetes]], the [[Cloud Native]] Computing Foundation:

-   Provides a neutral home for the [[Kubernetes]] trademark and enforces proper usage
-   Provides license scanning of core and vendor code
-   Offers legal guidance on patent and copyright issues
-   Creates open source learning [curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum), [training](https://www.cncf.io/certification/training/), and certification for both [[Kubernetes]] [administrators](https://www.cncf.io/certification/CKA/) (CKA) and [application developers](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/) (CKAD)
-   Manages a software conformance [working group](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-k8s-conformance)
-   Actively markets [[Kubernetes]]
-   Supports ad hoc activities
-   Sponsors conferences and meetup events.
