# Microservices
**[[Microservices]]** are lightweight applications written in various modern programming languages, with specific dependencies, libraries and environmental requirements. To ensure that an application has everything it needs to run successfully it is packaged together with its dependencies.

[[Containers]] encapsulate [[Microservices]] and their dependencies but do not run them directly. Containers run [[Container images]].
