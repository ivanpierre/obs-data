# API Server

All the administrative tasks are coordinated by the **kube-apiserver**, a central control plane component running on the [[Master Node]]. The API Server intercepts RESTful calls from users, operators and external agents, then validates and processes them. During processing the API Server reads the [[Kubernetes]] [[Cluster]]'s current state from the [[etcd]] data store, and after a call's execution, the resulting state of the [[Kubernetes]] [[Cluster]] is saved in the distributed key-value data store for persistence. The API Server is the only master plane component to talk to the [[etcd]] data store, both to read from and to save [[Kubernetes]] [[Cluster]] state information - acting as a middle interface for any other control plane agent inquiring about the [[Cluster]]'s state.

The API Server is highly configurable and customizable. It can scale horizontally, but it also supports the addition of custom secondary API Servers, a configuration that transforms the primary API Server into a proxy to all secondary, custom API Servers and routes all incoming RESTful calls to them based on custom defined rules.
