# Container images
A **[[Computing/DevOps/Containers/Containers]] image** bundles the application along with its runtime, libraries, and dependencies, and it represents the source of a [[Computing/DevOps/Containers/Containers]] deployed to offer an isolated executable environment for the application. [[Computing/DevOps/Containers/Containers]] can be deployed from a specific image on many platforms, such as workstations, Virtual Machines, public [[Cloud]], etc.
