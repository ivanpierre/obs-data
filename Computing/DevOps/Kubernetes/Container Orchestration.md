# Container Orchestration

In Development (Dev) environments, running containers on a single host for development and testing of applications may be an option. However, when migrating to Quality Assurance (QA) and Production (Prod) environments, that is no longer a viable option because the applications and services need to meet specific requirements:

-   Fault-tolerance
-   On-demand scalability
-   Optimal resource usage
-   Auto-discovery to automatically discover and communicate with each other
-   Accessibility from the outside world
-   Seamless updates/rollbacks without any downtime.

**[[Container orchestrators]]** are tools which group systems together to form clusters where containers' deployment and management is automated at scale while meeting the requirements mentioned above.
