# Stacked etcd topology

A stacked HA cluster is a [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology) where the distributed data storage cluster provided by [[etcd]] is stacked on top of the cluster formed by the nodes managed by [[kubeadm]] that run control plane components.

Each control plane node runs an instance of the `kube-apiserver`, `kube-scheduler`, and `kube-controller-manager`. The `kube-apiserver` is exposed to worker nodes using a load balancer.

Each control plane node creates a local [[etcd]] member and this [[etcd]] member communicates only with the `kube-apiserver` of this node. The same applies to the local `kube-controller-manager` and `kube-scheduler` instances.

This topology couples the control planes and [[etcd]] members on the same nodes. It is simpler to set up than a cluster with external [[etcd]] nodes, and simpler to manage for replication.

However, a stacked cluster runs the risk of failed coupling. If one node goes down, both an [[etcd]] member and a control plane instance are lost, and redundancy is compromised. You can mitigate this risk by adding more control plane nodes.

You should therefore run a minimum of three stacked control plane nodes for an HA cluster.

This is the default topology in [[kubeadm]]. A local [[etcd]] member is created automatically on control plane nodes when using `kubeadm init` and `kubeadm join --control-plane`.
