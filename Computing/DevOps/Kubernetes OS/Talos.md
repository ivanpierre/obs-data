# Talos
Talos is a [[Containers]] optimized Linux distro; a reimagining of Linux for distributed systems such as Kubernetes. Designed to be as minimal as possible while still maintaining practicality. For these reasons, Talos has a number of features unique to it:

-   it is immutable
-   it is atomic
-   it is ephemeral
-   it is minimal
-   it is secure by default
-   it is managed via a single declarative configuration file and gRPC API

Talos can be deployed on [[Containers]], cloud, virtualized, and bare metal platforms.
