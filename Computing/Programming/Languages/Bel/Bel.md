# Bel

Oct 2019  
  
Bel is a spec for a new dialect of Lisp, written in itself. This should sound familiar to people who know about Lisp's origins, because it's [the way Lisp began](http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html).  
  
It consists of two text files meant to be read in parallel: a [guide to the Bel language](https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bellanguage.txt?t=1595850613&), and the [Bel source](https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bel.bel?t=1595850613&).  
  
For those who just want to see some code examples, there's a [file of those](https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/belexamples.txt?t=1595850613&). But of course the Bel source is also a code example, since it's written in itself.  
  
Considering the rate at which I was discovering bugs before publishing Bel, there are bound to be more remaining. So this first version is version C, after Cunningham's Law.
