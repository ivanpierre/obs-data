𝗚𝗙𝗣-𝗚𝗔𝗡 is a blind face restoration algorithm towards real-world face images. It leverages the generative face prior in a pre-trained GAN to restore realistic faces while preserving fidelity.  
  
Blind face restoration aims at recovering high-quality faces from the low-quality counterparts suffering from unknown degradation, such as low-resolution, noise, blur, compression artifacts, etc.  
  
This Generative Facial Prior (GFP) is incorporated into the face restoration process via channel-split spatial feature transform layers, which allow for a good balance between realness and fidelity.  
  
The results are amazing!
